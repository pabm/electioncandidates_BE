List of election candidates in Belgian elections

This list includes election candidates for selected Belgian elections. We include all levels of elections: local elections (municipal, municipal district, OCMW/CPAS, provinces), regional elections (communities, regions), federal elections, and elections for the European Parliament. With the notable exception of the 2018 municipal elections in Flanders for which an exportable list was available, candidate lists were obtained by web scraping procedures. A list of elections used to construct this data, is provided below. 

Included elections:
2004 regional elections
2004 EU elections 
2007 federal elections
2009 regional elections
2009 EU elections 
2012 municipal elections Flanders
2012 municipal elections Wallonia
2012 municipal elections Brussels
2018 municipal elections Flanders
2018 municipal elections Wallonia
2018 municipal elections Brussels
2019 federal elections
2019 regional elections
2019 EU elections 

For a limited number of elections, we are also able to identify the political party each candidate is affiliated with. We obtain this information for the regional and federal elections of 2014 and 2018, as well as for the 2010 federal elections. This implies that municipal connections, as well as federal connections before 2010 and regional connections before 2014, can no longer be included in our indicators, because we do not identify (groups of) parties for these elections.
